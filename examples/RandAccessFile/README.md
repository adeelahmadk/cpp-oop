# Random Access File Example

The source code of the example program in the Random-Access File I/O contains:

- `inputs.h`, `inputs.cpp`: library functions to take valid input from a user
- `record.h`, `record.cpp`: classes that define record object properties and methods.

The driver programs that different operations on a random-access (RA) file are:

| Program          | Description                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| CreateRAFile.cpp | Create or initialize a RA file |
| ReadRAFile.cpp   | Read data from RA file         |
| SearchRecord.cpp | Search a record in a RA file   |
| UpdateRecord.cpp | Update a record in a RA file   |
| DeleteRecord.cpp | Delete a record in a RA file   |
